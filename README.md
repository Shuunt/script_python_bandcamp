# script_python_bandcamp
a short script to extract a lot of zip files from bandcamp

As I often download a lot of albums in a row once in a while from Bandcamp, I needed a script to unzip all these files with ease.
All you need to do is to have a repertory where you'll put all your albums zips and launch the script from there with this command line

```python bandcamp.py *```

Or you can move the script with it's .bat and launch the .bat instead

tried on windows
